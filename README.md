# Why use XpBottles?
Looking for a plugin strictly focused on retrieving XP from a bottle when you kill someone or when you die? Well this is it! Also if you are looking for a new way for your players to store their XP go with our plugin which may reduce lag.

* To-Do list:
  * - [ ] Make plugin more customizable.
  * - [ ] Make xp bottles non-stackable.
